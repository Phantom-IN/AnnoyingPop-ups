# Are You An Idiot?
This is just a fun Swing COde which creates a JFrame which cannot be extied unless you accecpt that You are an idiot! This code was created in free time and just for fun.

## Working 
It has a JLable saying "You are an idiot...!" and has two JButtons "Yes" and "No". However, 'No' button changes its place when clicked, so user is left with only one option that is 'Yes'. The code automatically exits once the user presses 'Yes' button and changes the JLable text.
